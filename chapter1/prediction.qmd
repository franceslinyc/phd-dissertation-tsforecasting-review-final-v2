# Prediction {#sec-ch1-pred}

@tbl-pred-gamma summaries the $95\%$ one-step ahead posterior predictive intervals for Scenario 1 through 9. As presented in this table, the model appropriately captures the predictive uncertainty across all scenarios. @fig-pred-gamma-s12 illustrate these intervals for Scenario 1 and 2. The differences in the observed patterns arise from the specific configurations of the weight and dependence parameters in each scenario; Scenario 1 employs exponentially decreasing weight and dependence, while Scenario 2 adopts an uneven arrangement of weight and dependence across lags. Additional plots illustrating the intervals for Scenarios 3 through 9 (@fig-pred-gamma-s3456, @fig-pred-gamma-s789) are provided in the @sec-appendix-ch1-add-pred.
