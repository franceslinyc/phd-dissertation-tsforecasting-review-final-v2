## ZI Count Models {#sec-ch2-background-zi-count}

Zero-inflated count data are prevalent across diverse domains such as finance, economics, healthcare, transportation, and ecology. Examples include claim frequencies in automobile insurance [@chowdhury2019group; @zhang2022new; @bermudez2022copula; @simmachan2024comparison; @slime2025optimizing], the number of business service firms within an airport economic zone [@jiang2018locational], the frequency of medical service use [@pizer2011time; @chatterjee2018group], crash counts or accident frequencies [@dong2014examining; @hao2016research; @liu2018multivariate; @mathew2021highway], and species abundances [@martin2005zero]. 

Accordingly, there is a rich literature on zero-inflated count models in these domains. For a comprehensive review of zero-inflated count regression models, as well as zero-inflated count time series, spatial, and multivariate models, we refer the reader to @young2022zero1 and @young2022zero2, respectively. 

Our primary goal is to develop models for zero-inflated continuous time series data. To provide a foundation for this discussion, we review two zero-inflated count time series models in the next section. 

## ZI Count Models for Dependent Data {#sec-ch2-background-zi-count-dependent}

### State Space Models

@yang2015statespace propose a state space or dynamic model for zero-inflated count time series. @feng2020zero extends this framework to continuous-valued zero-inflated time series, resulting in the development of the dynamic semi-continuous zero-inflated (DSCZI) model. 

Both the dynamic model and the MTD model include a latent state and can be classified as state space models. However, they differ in how they capture time dependence. In particular, the dynamic model introduces a continuous latent process that evolves over time according to a autoregressive (AR) process of order $p$, which can be equivalently represented as a $p$-dimentional AR($1$) process. In contrast, the MTD framework represents time dependence via a set of discrete latent variables, each selecting a lag-specific kernel among $L$ kernels. These latent variables determine which lag-specific kernel governs the current state through a random but non-dynamically evolving mechanism. As a result, while the dynamic model represents temporal evolution via a continuous, hidden state process, the MTD model captures time dependence through the dynamics embedded in the lag-specific kernels, with selection governed by a set of discrete, static latent variables. 

In the standard MTD framework, these latent variables are assumed to be independent, but in some variants, the discrete latent state structure can be dynamic. For example, @bartolucci2010note propose a model in which the discrete latent variables follow a hidden Markov chain and note that further generalizations, though possible, often result in models with a large number of parameters and require computationally intensive algorithms for fitting. In addition, with the advancement of modern computing, @yang2015statespace suggest a full Bayesian framework using a MCMC approach for future work. 

### Copula-Based Markov Models

@alqawba2019copula and @alqawba2021copula propose the copula-based Markov zero-inflated count time series model, utilizing marginal distributions such as the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), and zero-inflated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (ZICMP). 

Similarly, the MTD and NNMP models belong to the class of first-order Markov models. However, copulas were not incorporated into these frameworks until the later work of @zheng2023nnmp and @zheng2023nnmpdiscrete. Even then, in the discrete spatial NNMP models, @zheng2023nnmpdiscrete utilize copulas in a different manner. More specifically, @alqawba2019copula and @alqawba2021copula directly compute the joint PMF of $(X_t, X_{t-1})$ and express it using a copula function adapted for discrete variables, from which the conditional probability is obtained by dividing by the marginal of $x_{t-1}$. In contrast, @zheng2023nnmpdiscrete adopt the continuous extension approach, associating each discrete variable with a continuous variable. This enables the direct use of copulas in a continuous setting to construct the transition kernel in a structured mixture. Once the continuous variables are introduced, the conditional probability is specified as a mixture over $L$ transition kernels, each constructed from the bivariate random vector $(U_l, V_l)$, with the dependence between $U_l$ and $V_l$ captured by a copula function. 

Although copula-based Markov models have been widely applied to count and zero-inflated count data in both time series and spatial contexts, their application to zero-inflated continuous data remains largely unexplored.

## ZI Continuous models 

Zero-inflated continuous data frequently appear in domains such as healthcare, insurance, environment, and transportation. While existing literature has primarily focused on zero-inflated count data, there has been relatively less attention given to zero-inflated continuous data. Nevertheless, these studies suggest promising potential for broader applications. For example, @mills2013zigamma conducts two-part tests for zero-inflated Gamma (ZIG) and zero-inflated log-normal (ZILN) models and applies them to assess driving risk in individuals with neurological conditions. @zhou2020two develope a two-part hidden Markov model and apply it to analyze data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to enhance prognosis and support early treatment. @feng2020zero applies dynamic semi-continuous zero-inflated (DSCZI) time series model to analyze adaptive cruise control data to investigate driversâ€™ braking behavior, informing the in-vehicle assistance design. @sun2020zispatial compares the spatial Gaussian copula model with the kriging and the spatial random forests for zero-inflated forestry inventory prediction, crucial for ecosystem management. More recently, @kaewprasert2022simultaneous and @kaewprasert2024bayesian construct Bayesian and fiducial intervals and apply them to rainfall data from northern Thailand, informing the design of disaster warning systems. @zou2024fiducial construct fiducial-based intervals for the ZIG distribution and apply them to lipid profiles in a lung cancer study, enhancing screening and staging accuracy. 

The DSCZI model by @feng2020zero is built based on the dynamic framework by @yang2015statespace, as discussed in @sec-ch2-background-zi-count-dependent. Conditioning on the latent state, the model uses logistic regression to model the zero values and a Gamma distribution for the positive responses. For parameter estimation, the DSCZI model utilizes the data cloning method [@lele2007data; @lele2010estimability; @al2019estimation], which leverages Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to approximate maximum likelihood estimates, avoiding gradient-based methods due to the intractable marginal likelihood and latent variable complexity. 

Although data cloning provides a practical approach for intractable likelihoods and is robust to the choice of prior distributions, it can be computationally expensive and sensitive to the choice of the number of clones [@lele2007data]. Moreover, convergence diagnostics can be challenging, and identifiability issues may persist even after cloning [@lele2007data]. In contrast, MCMC draws samples from the full posterior distribution, providing a more comprehensive quantification of parameter uncertainty.

## The Continuous Extension Approach

The continuous extension (CE) approach was first proposed by @denuit2005constraints. Under the CE framework, @madsen2009spatial introduces a discrete spatial Gaussian copula regresion model and applies it to the Japanese beetle grub data, while @zheng2023nnmpdiscrete develop a discrete spatial copula NNMP regression model to study North American Breeding Bird Survey data. Using this approach, each discrete random variable, $Y_i$, is associated with a continuous variable, $Y_i^*$, defined as
```{=latex} 
\begin{equation}
Y_i^* = Y_i - U_i,
\end{equation}
```
where $U_i$ follows a continuous uniform distribution on $(0, 1)$, independent of both $Y_i$ and $U_j$, for $i \neq j$. The resulting $Y_i^*$ is a continuous random variable. Not only does this continuous extension of $Y_i$ preserves all information, but $Y^*_i$ and $Y^*_j$ also retain the dependence structure of $Y_i$ and $Y_j$, as shown by @denuit2005constraints. 

Our work once again builds upon the MTD time series model by @zheng2022construction and draws inspiration from the NNMP and the discrete NNMP spatial models developed by the same authors [@zheng2023nnmp; @zheng2023nnmpdiscrete]. Additional motivation comes from the work of @monleon2019small and @sun2020zispatial, which extend the spatial Gaussian copula model of @madsen2009spatial by adapting the CE approach for zero-inflated continuous data. Building onto these models, we propose to reconstruct the marginal distribution to accomondate for zero-inflation. We present the proposed model in the next chapter.
