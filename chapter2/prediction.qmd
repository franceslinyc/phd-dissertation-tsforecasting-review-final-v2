# Prediction {#sec-ch2-pred}

@tbl-pred-zigamma-s1 and @tbl-pred-zigamma-s2 summarize the $95\%$ one-step ahead posterior predictive intervals for Scenario 1 and 2, respectively. The overall coverage can obscure important differences in predictive performance. To provide a clearer picture, we decompose the coverage into **below** and **above**. As shown in these tables, when the zero-inflated probability is low (e.g., $P = 0.1$), the empirical coverage **above** (i.e., the coverage for data greater than $\epsilon$) is a more informative metric for assessing predictive performance. As $P$ increases (e.g., $P = 0.5$, $0.7$), the empirical coverage **below** (i.e., the coverage for data less than or equal to $\epsilon$) becomes increasingly dominant. 

When $P$ is small, a large proportion of observations fall above $\epsilon$, providing more information to estimate coverage in the upper range. As $P$ increases, more observations concentrate below $\epsilon$, making the coverage in the near-zero range the primary indicator of the overall performance. This shift reflects the change in the underlying data distribution, where increasing $P$ results in a higher proportion of near-zero values. Similiar patterns are observed across all scenarios considered in the simulation study. @fig-pred-zigamma-s1 and @fig-pred-zigamma-s2 convey the same findings but present the empirical coverage as time series for Scenario 1 and 2, respectively. Additional plots for Scenario 3 through 9 are provided in the @sec-appendix-ch2-add-pred.
