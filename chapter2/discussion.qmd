In this work, we review existing models for zero-inflated dependent count and continuous data, as well as the continuous extension approach, and propose a novel copula-based zero-inflated MTD model that extends the existing framework. We also present the algorithms and simulation studies, which demonstrate promising results across various scenarios. The advantage of our proposed approach is that, by reconstructing semi-continuous distributions into continuous forms, it preserves the effectiveness of copula modeling for capturing dependence structures, while retaining flexibility in the selection of marginal distributions in zero-inflated continuous settings. 

In real-world settings, dependence structures often exhibit features such as tail dependence or asymmetry that cannot be adequately captured by the Gaussian copula. Further research should explore alternative copula families, such as the Clayton or Gumbel copulas, along with efficient estimation techniques and practical applications, to better capture complex dependence patterns in empirical data. 

Although the framework could, in principle, be extended to handle non-stationary time series and incorporate predictors, these features are not currently implemented. Consequently, it cannot adequately model non-stationary data with trends and seasonality, limiting its practical effectiveness. In addition, the lack of support for predictors prevents the model from jointly capturing the effects of past observations and relevant predictors. Extending the framework to a non-stationary and regression-based setting would enable it to handle evolving dynamics and integrate both sources of information, thereby enhancing its flexibility and applicability to real-world data.
