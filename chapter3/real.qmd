# Data Applications: NASA MERRA-2 Wind Speeds Data {#sec-ch3-real}

## Experimental Setup 

### Data Access and Description

The MERRA-2 wind speed data is accessed and downloaded from the NASA GES DISC Earthdata API, and subsequently processed to extract and interpolate wind speed components at multiple heights (50 m, 10 m, 2 m) for the Limon Wind Energy Center, the largest wind farm in Colorado. @fig-windspeed-ch3 shows the time series of wind speeds (m/s) at these heights for 2024. 

The datasets used for the experiments are: 

1. wind speeds (m/s) at heights of 50 m above ground level

2. wind speeds (m/s) at heights of 10 m above ground level

3. wind speeds (m/s) at heights of 2 m above ground level

### Model Configuration and Implementation

For MTD, the hyperparameter settings are detailed in @sec-ch1-comp. MTD is implemented in `R` and executed on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. Training is performed following the procedure described in Algorithm \ref{alg:mcmc}. 

For LSTM, we reuse the default configuration for subsequent experiments: learning rate = $0.001$, batch size = $32$, number of layers = $1$, and cell dimension = $64$. LSTM is implemented in `PyTorch` and trained on a standard workstation.

During training, each iteration of the LSTM loop involves:

1. Perform a forward pass to obtain predictions. 

2. Calculate the loss between predictions and targets. 

3. Compute gradients of the loss with respect to network parameters via backpropagation. 

4. Update the parameters using the Adam optimizer. 

5. Return the training loss. 

## Results 

### Prediction Results

In the initial configuration, the LSTM network are trained using an L2 loss function and evaluated against the MTD model using RMSE. For MAE evaluation, a separate LSTM is trained with an L1 loss function. In contrast, MTD does not rely on training with an explicit loss function. 

To facilitate a more rigorous and independent comparison, we incorporate additional error metrics, namely MAPE, SMAPE, and MASE to evaluate and compare the performance of the LSTM and MTD models. All LSTM models are trained using an L2 loss function, except for the one evaluated with MAE, which is trained using an L1 loss function.

As shown in Tables (@tbl-real-uv50, @tbl-real-uv10, @tbl-real-uv2), MTD consistently outperforms the LSTM models across all evaluated metrics and training configurations for wind speeds at 50 m, 10 m, and 2 m above ground level. Since all reported MASE values are less than 1, this indicates that both models outperform the naïve forecasting benchmark on average.

To strengthen the comparison, we conduct an additional experiment by increasing the LSTM input window size, $W$, and the MTD order, $L$, from $5$ to $15$ (i.e., longer look-back steps). We then re-evaluate these models using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and SMAPE. 

As shown in Tables (@tbl-real-uv50-L15, @tbl-real-uv10-L15, @tbl-real-uv2-L15), the performance of the LSTM network shows slight improvement with a larger window size, though the gains are minimal. In contrast, the MTD model shows no performance gain, but still consistently outperform the LSTM across all metrics.

Given that batch size appears to be an important hyperparameter for LSTM, we further test values of $8$, $16$, $64$, $128$, and $256$, compared to the baseline of $32$. Nevertheless, none of these settings yield better performance than the MTD model. Corresponding training and validation loss plots are provided in the @sec-appendix-ch3-add-pred-real. 

@fig-pred-real illustrates the one-step-ahead predicted mean wind speeds (in m/s) between LSTM and MTD models at heights of 50 m, 10 m, and 2 m above ground level. @fig-pred-real-zoom presents a zoomed-in view of the same plot, focusing on a subset of the test data ($n = 200$). Prediction error plots (@fig-pred-real-diff, @fig-pred-real-zoom-diff) are provided in @sec-appendix-ch3-add-pred-real.

### Empirical Coverage of the MTD Model

Empirical coverage is particularly relevant for probabilistic forecasting methods such as MTD, where uncertainty estimation is an integral part of the model output. Therefore, in addition to standard evaluation metrics, MTD is also assessed using this technique to evaluate the reliability of its predictive intervals.

@tbl-pred-mtd-real summaries the $95\%$ one-step ahead posterior predictive intervals for wind speeds (m/s) at heights of 50 m, 10 m, and 2 m above ground level. As shown in the table, the model appropriately captures the predictive uncertainty across wind speeds at all heights. @fig-pred-mtd-real and @fig-pred-mtd-real-L15 illustrate these intervals.
